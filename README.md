## Bio
I am a former educator who, during the last five years, successfully transitioned into a career in front-end development. My professional journey in tech has been diverse, spanning from client work across various industries to contributing to a startup venture. This broad spectrum of experiences has honed my ability to adapt swiftly to distinct work environments, grasp new systems, languages, and procedures, and effectively address the unique demands of each project. To any development context, I bring with me the utmost attention to detail and commitment to quality code that is secure, scalable, and serves users well.
