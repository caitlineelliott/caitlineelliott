## Bio
I‚Äôve been dabbling with making fun stuff on the internet since I wrote some simple HTML and CSS for my first website when I was thirteen years old. I didn‚Äôt have much to put on it since I was, well, thirteen, so the content mostly consisted of how much I loved Legolas from Lord of the Rings.

From there, I moved on to customizing my MySpace profile and Neopets page, as well as editing tumblr and WordPress themes. In college, I was a wedding photographer and created my own branding package and website. I remember thinking ‚ÄúI should start a blog!‚Äù at various points, only to get more excited about designing and coding the site than actually writing posts.

Despite my almost 20 years of experience with web design and development as a hobby, I had never previously pursued it as a career. However, the past couple of years showed me it was time for a change, and I‚Äôm excited to begin my journey into this realm professionally.

In September 2021, I graduated from Udacity‚Äôs Front End Web Developer Nanodegree, and I‚Äôm ready to find an organization to partner with.
